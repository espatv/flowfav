## 📥 Installation

> **Language Support:**
> If the addon is not in your preferred language after installation, check the [Releases](https://github.com/fullstackcurso/Flow-FavManager/releases) section for more language options.

### Option 1: From Kodi File Manager (Recommended)
This is the simplest method as it does not require manually downloading external files and enables automatic updates:

1. Open Kodi and go to **Settings** (gear icon).
2. Enter **File manager** and select **Add source**.
3. Click on `<None>` and type the following address: `https://fullstackcurso.github.io/Flow-FavManager/`

   > ⚠️ **VERY IMPORTANT:** You must type this address **EXACTLY**. **DO NOT** copy the address URL from your browser bar (github.com...), as that will not work in Kodi and will result in an empty folder.

4. Give the source a name (e.g., `flowfav`) and click **OK**.
5. Return to the main menu, enter **Add-ons**, and click the **open box icon** (top left).
6. Select **Install from zip file**.
   - *Note: If a security warning appears, go to Settings and enable "Unknown sources".*
7. Select the `flowfav` source and choose the file `repository.flowfavmanager-1.0.0.zip`.
8. Wait for the "**Add-on installed**" notification (this installs the repository).
9. Now, in the same menu, select **Install from repository**.
10. Go to **Flow FavManager Repository** > **Program add-ons** > **Flow FavManager** and click **Install**.

### Option 2: Manual Installation via ZIP File
1. Download the latest `repository.flowfavmanager-1.0.0.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/fullstackcurso/Flow-FavManager/releases) section.
2. In Kodi, go to **Add-ons** > **Package icon** > **Install from zip file**.
3. Locate the downloaded file on your device and select it to complete the installation.
