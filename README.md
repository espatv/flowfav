## 📥 Installation

> **Language Support:**
> If the addon is not in your preferred language after installation, check the [Releases](https://github.com/loioloio/flowfav/releases) section for more language options.

### Option 1: From Kodi File Manager (Recommended)
This is the simplest method as it does not require manually downloading external files and enables automatic updates:

1. Open Kodi and go to **Settings** (gear icon).
2. Enter **File manager** and select **Add source**.
3. Click on `<None>` and type the following address: https://loioloio.github.io/flowfav/

   > ⚠️ **VERY IMPORTANT:** You must type this address **EXACTLY**. **DO NOT** copy the address URL from your browser bar (github.com...), as that will not work in Kodi and will result in an empty folder.

4. Give the source a name (e.g., `flowfav`) and click **OK**.
5. Return to the main menu, enter **Add-ons**, and click the **open box icon** (top left).
6. Select **Install from zip file**.
   - *Note: If a security warning appears, go to Settings and enable "Unknown sources".*
7. Select the `flowfav` source and choose the file `repository.flowfavmanager-1.0.0.zip`.
8. Wait for the "**Add-on installed**" notification (this installs the repository).
9. Now, in the same menu, select **Install from repository**.
10. Go to **Flow FavManager Repository** > **Program add-ons** > **Flow FavManager** and click **Install**.

### Option 2: Manual Installation via ZIP File
1. Download the latest `repository.flowfavmanager-1.0.0.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/loioloio/flowfav/releases) section.
2. In Kodi, go to **Add-ons** > **Package icon** > **Install from zip file**.
3. Locate the downloaded file on your device and select it to complete the installation.

## 🧩 Features


#### 1. List and Profile Management
*   **Multi-Profile System:** Create, save and load multiple profiles, each stored as an independent JSON file. This keeps separate sets of favourites for different uses (e.g. kids, sports, films).
*   **Predefined Templates:** Load pre-defined favourite lists to populate a new Kodi installation.
*   **Template Editor:** Create, edit, import, export and reset your own template categories and items, not just the bundled ones.
*   **Quick Save:** Update the active profile without going through the confirmation menus.
*   **Import and Export:** Share profiles or move them between devices as XML files. Each profile can also be exported individually to its own XML file, and renamed or deleted from the same menu.
*   **Profile Browser:** Navigate a profile's contents as a standard Kodi folder without loading it as your active favourites.
*   **Dynamic Widget (Clean View Path):** A dedicated `/widget` path that exposes favourites as plain folders, intended to feed home-screen widgets in skins such as Aura, Arctic and Titan without the management buttons.

#### 2. Security and Privacy
*   **PIN Protection:** Lock the addon behind a numeric PIN, requested when you open Flow FavManager.
*   **Session Lock:** Once authenticated during a Kodi session, the addon does not ask for the PIN again until the session ends.
*   **Security Question:** An optional, user-configured recovery method to restore access if the PIN is forgotten.
*   **Rescue Mechanism:** An emergency `RESET_FILE` to recover access without losing data if the password is lost.
*   **Audit Log:** Internal logging of critical actions: security changes, profile deletions and failed access attempts.

#### 3. Bulk Organization and Automation Tools
*   **Flexible Reordering:** Reorder items in the visual editor with four selectable modes: swap two items, insert before, insert after, or move with the up/down arrows.
*   **Quick Move (per item):** From the context menu of any item in the advanced editor, jump it 1, 5 or 10 positions up/down, or send it straight to the top or bottom of the list.
*   **Multiselect Mode:** Select multiple favourites at once (checkbox style) to perform batch actions.
*   **Group Operations:**
    *   **Bulk Move:** Move a block of favourites to a new position in one operation (e.g. 20 channels from position 100 to position 1).
    *   **Bulk Delete:** Select and remove multiple items at once.
    *   **Bulk Coloring:** Apply a label colour to a whole selected group.
*   **Automatic Grouping:** Scans the list and regroups favourites by their source addon (e.g. all Netflix items together, all YouTube items together).
*   **Bulk Sorting:** Sort the whole list alphabetically (A-Z / Z-A) or reverse the current order.
*   **Profile Search:** Search by name across all your saved profiles and open any matching favourite directly.

#### 4. Deep Visual Editing and Customization
*   **Label Styling:** Change the text colour of individual favourites, or apply bold, italic or uppercase formatting.
*   **Separator Bars:** Insert visual separators (lines or text with no action) to divide the list into sections. When deleting a separator you can remove just the separator or the whole section beneath it.
*   **Icon Management:**
    *   **Automatic Enrichment:** Attempts to find and assign icons to favourites that lack one.
    *   **Manual Change:** Pick a custom image for any favourite from local storage.
*   **Accessibility Mode:** Settings to improve visibility, such as high-contrast modes and adapted palettes (e.g. colour-blind mode).

#### 5. Advanced Creation and Manipulation
*   **Manual Item Creation:** Create a favourite from scratch by entering the label and the path (URL/command) manually, for users who know Kodi's internal paths.
*   **Entry Duplication:** Clone an existing favourite to create variations of the same channel or path.
*   **Path Editing:** Edit the command or URL of an existing favourite without deleting and recreating it.
*   **Addon Selector:** A built-in browser to locate and add favourites from any installed addon without leaving the editor.
*   **Global Context Menu:** Add content to a profile from any Kodi list (movies, channels, music) through the context menu (right click), without opening the addon.
*   **Compatibility Maximizer:** Internal logic (`build_list_item`) that normalises problematic URLs (scripts, commands without quotes) so favourites remain runnable, working around limitations of Kodi's favourites format.

#### 6. Complete Backup System
*   **Backup/Restore:** Create full backups of the `favourites.xml` file and restore them at any time.

#### 7. Web Remote Control (New in v2.0.0)
*   **Browser-Based Management:** Access and organise favourites from any device on the local network (PC, phone, tablet) through a responsive web interface.
*   **Interactive Actions:** Move favourites up/down, rename and delete items, with modal dialogs and toast notifications.
*   **Artwork Loading:** Shows each favourite's cover/thumbnail artwork, served through a proxy that resolves Kodi image URLs.
*   **Visual Customization:** Adapts to the system's dark or light mode automatically.

#### 8. Auto-start Favourites on Startup (New in v2.0.0)
*   **Startup Launcher:** Configure up to three favourites (addons, lists, commands) to launch automatically when Kodi starts.

#### 9. Main Menu Redesign (New in v2.0.0)
*   **Custom White Icons:** Replaced the generic Kodi icons with custom white Material icons.
*   **Visual Style:** Simplified the colour scheme to white typography.

#### 10. Add Editor to Favourites (New in v2.0.0)
*   **Quick Shortcut Option:** A settings option to add the advanced editor directly to Kodi favourites.

#### 11. Quick Editor
*   **Dialog-Based Editing:** A lightweight editor built on plain Kodi dialogs (no graphical window) to move, rename and delete favourites; handy on low-power devices or for a fast change.

#### 12. Additional Tools
*   **Open Kodi Favourites:** A shortcut that opens Kodi's native favourites window (picking the right one for your Kodi version).
*   **Save and Reload:** Reload the active profile and clear the texture cache so updated icons show up immediately.
*   **Multi-language Interface**
